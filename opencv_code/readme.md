This is my first time using python, opencv, and matplotlib(for histograms)

To learn how to use python and cv2 commands, I had to use google to get help and often had to follow the exact lines of code to see how each of the code line works. 

I know we are not allowed to "copy" codes from the internet (although I did try to change it up + included as much as comments as possible to show I understand what is going on)(Also, I have ran all the codes and modified where necessary to make it work), but I honestly cannot think of another way to learn python and image processing commands without looking at other people's code at this moment as I have 0 prior experience.  

If you consider this as academic dishonesty, please let me know. I will try to figure out another way to learn.
